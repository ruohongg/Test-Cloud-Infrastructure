## Comparision:

When running Jupyter Notebook in Docker on my laptop, the CPU usage is nearly 0%, and it uses around 95.41 MiB of memory. On the other hand, running Jupyter Notebook directly on a virtual machine uses 3-4% CPU and about 1.09 GB of memory.

This shows that Docker is more efficient in terms of CPU and memory usage compared to running Jupyter Notebook on a VM.
